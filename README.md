# My YAML Resume

Most people don't accept YAML resumes, so this allows me to convert mine to
markdown, HTML, and PDF.

## How do I get the PDF version?

I cheat by just opening the HTML version in Safari and printing it. :-)

[This link](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/sgatewood/resume/raw/main/rendered/resume.pdf) sends the current (manually created & committed) version to the google docs viewer.
