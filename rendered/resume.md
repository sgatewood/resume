## ðŸ’¼ Experience

#### **DevOps Engineer**, Digital Asset
(New York, NY / remote) April 2023 - present
- Develop and maintain infrastructure and automation around critical kubernetes services, applying SRE practices to ensure reliability and minimize manual operational toil.
- Automated the deployment of a new mission-critical service in a dedicated GKE cluster with all supporting cloud infrastructure. Utilized Terraform, Jsonnet, Bash, and Helm to automate deployments and orchestrate complex blockchain migrations. Instrumented monitoring/alerts with DataDog and regularly use it to tune our configuration. Communicated effective designs with partner companies, helping them overcome similar hurdles and accelerating the launch of our blockchain network.
- Expanded production monitoring capabilities by authoring a custom metrics exporter in Go, providing a programmatic framework to close critical gaps in observability.
- Authored a custom k8s operator in Go to streamline our backup/restore process, eliminating manual operational tasks on a product that was entering maintenance mode.
- Developed CI/CD pipelines using Google Cloud Build and CircleCI.

#### **Software Engineer II**, Appian Corporation
(McLean, VA / remote) August 2020 - April 2023
- Worked on a Development Experience team that created and maintained a variety of developer tooling and infrastructure, gaining a unique perspective on usability that continues to shape my tooling designs today.
- Contributed to a remote development solution, including a custom Kubernetes service to lease EC2s and a python tool to build/develop/test the product remotely (rather than on your own machine).
- Architected and developed a pipeline to create warm builds that developers can take and use instantly rather than waiting to build from source.
- Initiated & developed numerous prototypes, many of which shipped (or became real quarter-long features for my team).
- Regularly initiated & led architectural design discussions.
- Regularly assisted developers in troubleshooting technical issues, both to help unblock them and to find ways to improve our local build stability.
- Treasured high code quality standards and contributed to our data-driven goal to lead the department in code quality and component health.
- Mentored two interns as a Summer Intern Manager, meeting with them weekly to optimize their internship experience.

#### **Software Engineering Intern**, Uber Advanced Technologies Group
(Pittsburgh, PA) May 2019 - August 2019
- Developed and benchmarked alternate implementations for a key-value store using various database technologies (e.g. LevelDB, Sqlite3).

- Helped manage the course as one of four "Head TAs."

#### **Software Engineering Intern**, NASA Langley Research Center
(Hampton, VA) May 2018 - May 2019

## ðŸ’» Projects

#### **[This Resume](https://github.com/sgatewood/resume)**
February 2022 - present
- I didn't have Microsoft Word anymore, so I wrote this in YAML and rendered it into the document you are reading. :-)
- This was just more fun than LaTeX

#### **[JobDeployment controller](https://github.com/sgatewood/job-deployment)**
Summer 2025
- Mostly just wanted to get my hands on<a href="https://book.kubebuilder.io/">kubebuilder</a>
- This could in theory solve a DX problem I had with deploying kubernetes jobs from helm

#### **[gcloud-fzf](https://github.com/sgatewood/gcloud-fzf)**
Spring 2025
- Made a go CLI that I wanted for a hyper-specific use case
- The interesting piece is I can install it through my own homebrew tap!

#### **[Portfolio site](https://sgatewood.github.io)**
Spring 2022
- Sorta abused an old Jekyll theme I liked to serve as a portfolio site
- Includes some interesting hacks including dark mode and some MermaidJS magic
