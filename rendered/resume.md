## ðŸ’¼ Experience

#### **Software Engineer II**, Appian Corporation
(McLean, VA) August 2020 - present
- Member of a SCRUM team that creates and maintains a variety of developer tooling and infrastructure.
- Contributed to a remote development solution, including a custom Kubernetes service to lease EC2s and a python tool to build/develop/test the product remotely (rather than on your own machine).
- Architected and developed a pipeline to create warm builds that developers can take and use instantly rather than waiting to build from source.
- Helped design and implement a modern feature toggles framework for a legacy codebase. Designed and implemented an internal dashboard allowing developers to easily change toggle values on internal sites.
- Initiated & developed numerous prototypes, many of which shipped (or became real quarter-long features for my team).
- Regularly initiated & led architectural design discussions.
- Regularly assisted developers in troubleshooting technical issues, both to help unblock them and to find ways to improve our local build stability.
- Treasured high code quality standards and contributed to our data-driven goal to lead the department in code quality and component health.
- Mentored two interns as a Summer Intern Manager, meeting with them weekly to optimize their internship experience.

#### **Software Engineering Intern**, Uber Advanced Technologies Group
