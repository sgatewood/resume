experience:
  - title: DevOps Engineer
    company: Digital Asset
    location: New York, NY / remote
    dates: April 2023 - present
    notes:
      - Develop and maintain infrastructure and automation around critical kubernetes services, applying SRE practices to ensure reliability and minimize manual operational toil.
      - Automated the deployment of a new mission-critical service in a dedicated GKE cluster with all supporting cloud infrastructure. Utilized Terraform, Jsonnet, Bash, and Helm to automate deployments and orchestrate complex blockchain migrations. Instrumented monitoring/alerts with DataDog and regularly use it to tune our configuration. Communicated designs with partner companies, helping them overcome similar hurdles and accelerating the launch of our blockchain network. Uptime requirements were extremely high -- any downtime required auditing financial losses.
      - Expanded production monitoring capabilities by authoring a custom Prometheus metrics exporter in Go, providing a programmatic framework to close critical gaps in observability.
      - Authored a custom k8s operator in Go to streamline our backup/restore process, eliminating manual operational tasks on a product that was entering maintenance mode.
      - Developed CI/CD pipelines using Google Cloud Build and CircleCI.
      - Participated in on-call rotations, triaging a multitude of production alerts and maintaining the reliability of our services.
      - Built isolated blockchain test environments in both k3d (for local dev) and vClusters, enabling developers to effortlessly spin up fully independent networks.
  - title: Software Engineer II
    company: Appian Corporation
    location: McLean, VA / remote
    dates: August 2020 - April 2023
    notes:
      - Worked on a Development Experience team that created and maintained a variety of developer tooling and infrastructure, gaining a unique perspective on usability that continues to shape my tooling designs today.
      - Contributed to a remote development solution, including a custom Kubernetes service to lease EC2s and a python tool to build/develop/test the product remotely (rather than on your own machine).
      - Architected and developed a Gitlab pipeline to precook warm builds that developers could take and use instantly rather than waiting to build from source, providing an extremely fast setup to "test something on a recent main build."
      - Regularly initiated & led architectural design discussions, and spiked a wide variety of prototypes.
      - Regularly unblocked developers by assisting in troubleshooting technical issues, improving our local build stability.
      - Treasured high code quality standards and contributed to our data-driven goal to lead the department in code quality.
      - Mentored two interns as a Summer Intern Manager, meeting with them weekly to optimize their internship experience.
