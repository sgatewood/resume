    notes:
      - Developed infrastructure and automation around critical kubernetes services, applying SRE practices to ensure reliability and minimize operational toil.
      - Played an instrumental role in the launch of our blockchain network by owning the greenfield deployment and management of a core validator node.
      - Utilized Terraform, Jsonnet, Bash, and Helm to automate deployments in a flexible manner, enabling the success of more than 70 weekly upgrades.
      - Orchestrated a complex blockchain migration process in the deployment automation, reducing required live-on-zoom code changes down to 0.
      - Migrated our node's cluster across GCP regions with only 2 minutes of downtime.
      - Instrumented monitoring/alerts with DataDog to maintain 99.5% uptime and tune our configuration to minimize cloud costs.
      - Communicated deployment designs with partner companies, helping them overcome similar hurdles and accelerating the launch of our blockchain network.
      - Mentored 2 teammates on how the validator deployment worked so they could contribute to the codebase and participate in support rotations.
      - Authored a Prometheus metrics exporter in Go, providing a programmatic framework for custom metrics. Closed 8 critical gaps in production observability.
      - Authored a Kubernetes operator in Go to streamline our backup/restore process, eliminating operational tasks on a product entering maintenance mode.
      - Migrated Kubernetes manifests from a legacy system to public helm charts, allowing external customers to deploy our product.
      - Orchestrated our internal helm installations using Helmfile to reduce our deployment process from 35 commands to 1 and pave the way for using GitOps.
      - Built isolated blockchain test environments in both k3d (for local dev) and vClusters, allowing developers to effortlessly spin up fully independent networks.
      - Developed CI/CD pipelines using Google Cloud Build and CircleCI.
      - Participated in on-call rotations, triaging a multitude of production alerts and maintaining the reliability of our services.

    company: Appian Corporation
    location: McLean, VA / remote
    dates: August 2020 - April 2023
    notes:
      - Worked on a Development Experience team that owned a variety of tooling and infrastructure to accelerate and modernize development workflows.
      - Contributed to a remote development platform allowing devs to build/develop/test on dedicated EC2s, improving cycle time and stability by at least 50%.
      - Built a Gitlab pipeline to precook warm builds that devs could take and use instantly, reducing startup time from ~12m to ~5s for many common test cases.
      - 'Architected a separate mode using <a href="https://mutagen.io/documentation/synchronization/">Mutagen</a> to enable bi-directional file syncing and enhance stability.'
      - Deployed a LaunchDarkly <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/docs/sdk/relay-proxy">relay proxy</a> in Kubernetes, satisfying a FedRAMP security requirement for our modern feature toggles initiative.
      - Contributed to a team effort to integrate LaunchDarkly with a legacy product, including developing our own Java client.
      - Regularly initiated & led architectural design discussions, and spiked a wide variety of prototypes.
      - Regularly unblocked developers by assisting in troubleshooting technical issues, improving our local build stability.
      - Utilized an ELK stack to collect diagnostics from our development tool, greatly enhancing visibility into command utilization and user flows.
      - Enhanced our documentation by injecting Matplotlib graphs (refreshed daily via Gitlab deployment pipeline) to show metrics on our codebase over time.
      - Treasured high code quality standards and contributed to our data-driven goal to lead the department in code quality.
      - Mentored two interns as a Summer Intern Manager, meeting with them weekly to optimize their internship experience.
      - Gained a high standard for usability that continues to shape my tooling designs today.
